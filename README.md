##Introduction##
Hi! We are ABLEs, a group of students who want to use our power to make our world better. 
In ETHGlobal Singapore, we have built a platform named **Identifiable**, which aims at helping disabled people to protect their sensitive information, like national identifiers, while still enjoying exclusive benefits such as vouchers, discounts, and memberships. 
In Malaysia, the government has put their effort in supporting diabled person, and we aim to take this further by engaging **all platforms that has a website** for long-term impact.
With Identifiable, disabled individuals can verify their status securely using blockchain technologies, especially **ZKP**. In the end, without disclosing personal details
Verified once, their status can be trusted across platforms, giving them the benefits they deserve while preserving their privacy.

##The system flow is as follow:##
1. **User Onboarding**: Users onboard through WorldCoin, ensuring a unique identity for each individual to prevent misuse of benefits. Each disabled person can only claim one verified beneficial account.
2. **Identity Verification**: The platform prompts users for their national identity number and verifies their status via an API connected to the government’s disability certification system. If confirmed, the system retrieves the image of the person. Then, permission for camera will be asked for, to see if they are the same person.
3. **Proof Generation**: Upon successful verification, the platform generates a cryptographic proof on the blockchain, which is indexed for quick retrieval by platforms offering benefits (e.g., eCommerce sites).

In our system, we have applied the technologies developed by ETHGlobal Singapore 2024's partners, who are Worldcoin, Dynamic.xyz, Sign Protocol, Noun DAO.
1. **WorldCoin**: We utilized WorldCoin's featuares to ensure one disabled individual can only have one verified account, safeguarding against misuse and ensuring the integrity of benefit claims.
2. **Dynamic.xyz**: Dynamic.xyz is applied in our onboarding session for ecommerce platform for a seamless login system that is easy to be implemented, enabling quick and secure logins.
3. **Sign Protocol**: Sign Protocol plays a crucial role in  assertion creation, querying, and smart contract hooks, ensuring trust and security in proof generation and revocation.
4. **Noun DAO**: NounDAO inspired our platform’s inclusive user interface, with pixel avatars representing individuals from all identities and backgrounds.

ABLEs believe in building more than just a platform—we are creating a vision where inclusivity, privacy, and opportunity come together. In here, we make dreams, we sell dreams.
